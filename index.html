    <h3>Defination</h3>
    <p>A cellular network or mobile network is a telecommunications network where the link to and from end nodes is wireless and the network is distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver. These base stations provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data, and other types of content. A cell typically uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed service quality within each cell.</p>

    <h3>Cellular networks offer a number of desirable features:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>More capacity than a single large transmitter, since the same frequency can be used for multiple links as long as they are in different cells</li>
        <li>Mobile devices use less power than with a single transmitter or satellite since the cell towers are closer</li>
        <li>Larger coverage area than a single terrestrial transmitter, since additional cell towers can be added indefinitely and are not limited by the horizon</li>
        <li>Capability of utilizing higher frequency signals (and thus more available bandwidth / faster data rates) that are not able to propagate at long distances</li>
        
    </ul>
