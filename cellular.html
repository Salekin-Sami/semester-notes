    <h2><strong>Cellular Network</strong></h2>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">What is Cellular Network?&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">A cellular network, also known as a mobile network, is a communication network where the link to and from end nodes is wireless1. The network is distributed over land areas called &ldquo;cells&rdquo;, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver, typically three cell sites or base transceiver stations. These base stations provide the cell with the network coverage which can be used for transmission of voice, data, and other types of content.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">A cell typically uses a different set of frequencies from&nbsp;neighboring&nbsp;cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed service quality within each cell1. When joined together, these cells provide radio coverage over a wide geographic area. This enables numerous portable transceivers (e.g., mobile phones, tablets and laptops equipped with mobile broadband modems, pagers, etc.) to communicate with each other and with fixed transceivers and telephones anywhere in the network, via base stations, even if some of the transceivers are moving through more than one cell during transmission1.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Cellular networks offer a number of desirable features:</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">More capacity than a single large transmitter, since the same frequency can be used for multiple links as long as they are in different cells</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Mobile devices use less power than with a single transmitter or satellite since the cell towers are closer</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="6" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Larger coverage area than a single terrestrial transmitter, since additional cell towers can be added indefinitely and are not limited by the horizon</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="7" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Capability of utilizing higher frequency signals (and thus more available bandwidth / faster data rates) that are not able to propagate at long distances</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="8" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">With data compression and multiplexing, several video (including digital video) and audio channels may travel through a higher frequency signal on a single wideband carrier</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><strong>Cell Size,Frequency Reuse and Others</strong></h2>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Cellular systems for mobile communications implement SDM. Each transmitter, typically called a base station, covers a certain area, a cell. What shapes do cells normally take on?&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Let us first consider the idealized situation where path loss depends only on the distance from the BS, but not the direction. The most natural choice would be a disk (circle), as it provides constant power at the cell boundary. However, disks cannot fill plane without either gaps or overlaps.&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Hexagons, on the other hand, have a shape similar to a circle, and they can fill up a plane, like in a beehive pattern. Thus, hexagons are usually considered the &ldquo;basic&rdquo; cell shape, especially for theoretical considerations. We stress, however, that hexagonal structures are only possible under the following circumstances:</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span data-contrast="auto">The required traffic density is independent of the location. This condition is obviously violated whenever the population density changes.&nbsp;</span></li>
        <li><span data-contrast="auto"> The terrain is completely flat, and there are no high edifices, so that path loss is influenced only by the distance from the BS</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Cell Planning with Hexagonal Cells : For the case of hexagonal cells, some interesting conclusions can be drawn about the relationship between link margin and reuse distance. Consider the hexagon whose&nbsp;center&nbsp;is at the origin of the coordinate system. Proceed now&nbsp;i&nbsp;hexagons in the y direction, turn 60◦ counterclockwise, and proceed k hexagons in that new direction. This gets us to the cell whose&nbsp;center&nbsp;has the following distance from the origin:</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">A equation will be included here.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Cellular mobile radio systems that use TDMA and FDMA rely upon&nbsp;frequency&nbsp;reuse, where users in geographically separated cells simultaneously use the same carrier frequency. The cellular layout of a conventional&nbsp;macrocellular&nbsp;system is quite often described by a uniform grid of hexagonal cells or radio coverage zones. In practice the cells are not regular hexagons, but instead are distorted and overlapping areas. The hexagon is an ideal choice for representing&nbsp;macrocellular&nbsp;coverage areas, because it closely approximates a circle and offers a wide range of&nbsp;tesellating&nbsp;reuse cluster sizes. A&nbsp;tesellating&nbsp;reuse cluster of size N can be constructed if [258]</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">A equation will be included here</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;where&nbsp;i&nbsp;and j are non-negative integers, and It follows that the allowable cluster sizes are Examples of 3-, 4-, and 7-cell reuse clusters are shown in Fig. 1.7. The reuse clusters are&nbsp;tesellated&nbsp;to form a frequency plan. A simplified 7-cell frequency reuse plan is shown in Fig. 1.8, where similarly marked cells use identical sets of carrier frequencies.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">The co-channel reuse factor D / R, is defined as the ratio of the co-channel reuse distance D between cells using the same set of carrier frequencies and the radius of the cells R1 . For hexagonal cells, the reuse cluster size N and the co-channel reuse factor D/R are related by</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">d/r = root(3,n);</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <h2><strong>Advantages</strong></h2>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Advantages of cellular systems with small cells are the following:&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span data-contrast="auto"> Higher capacity: Implementing SDM allows frequency reuse. If one transmitter is far away from another, i.e., outside the interference range, it can reuse the same frequencies. As most mobile sphoneystems assign frequencies to certain users (or certain hopping patterns), this frequency is blocked for other users. But frequencies are a scarce resource and, the number of concurrent users per cell is very limited. Huge cells do not allow for more users. On the contrary, they are limited to less possible users per km2. This is also the reason for using very small cells in cities where many more people use mobile phones.</span></li>
        <li><span data-contrast="auto"> Less transmission power: While power aspects are not a big problem for base stations, they are indeed problematic for mobile stations. A receiver far away from a base station would need much more transmit power than the current few Watts. But energy is a serious problem for mobile handheld devices.&nbsp;</span></li>
        <li><span data-contrast="auto"> Local interference only: Having long distances between sender and receiver results in even more interference problems. With small cells, mobile stations and base stations only have to deal with &lsquo;local&rsquo; interference.&nbsp;</span></li>
        <li><span data-contrast="auto"> Robustness: Cellular systems are decentralized and so, more robust against the failure of single components. If one antenna fails, this only influences communication within a small area.&nbsp;</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Small cells also have some disadvantages:</strong>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span data-contrast="auto"> Infrastructure needed: Cellular systems need a complex infrastructure to connect all base stations. This includes many antennas, switches for call forwarding, location registers to find a mobile station etc, which makes the whole system quite expensive&nbsp;</span></li>
        <li><span data-contrast="auto"> Handover needed: The mobile station has to perform a handover when changing from one cell to another. Depending on the cell size and the speed of movement, this can happen quite often.&nbsp;</span></li>
        <li><span data-contrast="auto"> Frequency planning: To avoid interference between transmitters using the same frequencies, frequencies have to be distributed carefully. On the one hand, interference should be avoided, on the other, only a limited number of frequencies is available.</span></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Frequency Reuse:</strong></span>&nbsp;</h3>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Frequency reuse is a technique used in wireless communication that allows the same frequency band to be used in different geographical areas, known as cells1. This is done as long as these cells are sufficiently far apart to prevent interference.</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span data-contrast="auto">Key points about frequency reuse:</span>&nbsp;</h3>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Each cellular base station is allocated a group of radio channels or frequency sub-bands to be used within a small geographic area known as a cell2.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">The process of selecting and allocating the frequency sub-bands for all of the cellular base stations within a system is called frequency reuse or frequency planning2.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Frequency reuse improves spectral efficiency and signal quality2.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">The number of times a frequency can be reused depends on the tolerance capacity of the radio channel from the nearby transmitter that is using the same frequencies2.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">In the frequency reuse scheme, the total bandwidth is divided into different sub-bands that are used by cells2.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="6" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">Cells that use the same set of frequencies are called co-channel cells2. These co-channel cells can result in interference, so to avoid this, cells that use the same set of channels or frequencies are separated from one another by a larger distance2.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="7" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto">In summary, frequency reuse increases the total capacity of the system without increasing its allocated bandwidth3. It improves spectral efficiency, provides better quality of service, and increases network capacity2.</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h2><span data-contrast="auto">Increase Capacity of Cellular Network</span>&nbsp;</h2>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">There are several methods for increasing the capacity of a cellular network, which is the ability to handle more calls or data traffic within a given area. Some of the common methods are:</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="2"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Cell splitting</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This method divides a congested cell into smaller cells, each with its own base station and reduced transmit power. This increases the number of channels per unit area and reduces the co-channel interference. However, this also increases the cost and complexity of the network, and requires more frequent handoffs.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="2"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Cell sectoring</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This method replaces a single omnidirectional antenna at the base station with multiple directional antennas, each covering a sector of the cell. This reduces the interference from adjacent cells using the same frequency, and allows more frequency reuse. However, this also requires more antennas and equipment at the base station, and increases the number of handoffs.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="2"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Microcell zone concept</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This method uses several low-power transmitters at the edge of the cell to create smaller zones within the cell. The mobile station retains the same channel as it moves from zone to zone, but the base station switches the channel to a different zone site. This reduces the interference and increases the capacity, but also requires more infrastructure and coordination among the zone sites.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="2"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Frequency hopping</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This method uses a technique of changing the carrier frequency of the signal in a pseudorandom sequence, known as a hopping pattern. This reduces the effect of interference and fading, and allows more users to share the same spectrum. However, this also requires synchronization and coordination among the users and the base station, and introduces some delay and overhead.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="2"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Spread spectrum</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This method uses a technique of spreading the signal over a wide bandwidth, using a code that is unique to each user. This increases the resistance to interference and jamming, and allows more users to share the same spectrum. However, this also requires complex signal processing and synchronization, and reduces the data rate per user.</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span data-contrast="auto">Handoff:</span>&nbsp;</h2>
   
    <p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Handoff</strong> is the process of transferring an ongoing call or data session from one base station to another as a mobile device moves across different cells1. Handoff can be classified into two types: hard and soft2. Hard handoff is a &ldquo;break before make&rdquo; connection, where the current link is terminated before a new link is established. Soft handoff is a &ldquo;make before break&rdquo; connection, where the mobile device is connected to more than one base station at the same time. Handoff can improve the quality and continuity of service in cellular networks, but it also involves some challenges such as&nbsp;signaling&nbsp;overhead, delay, and interference3.</span>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Handoff strategies</strong> are methods of transferring an ongoing call or data connectivity from one base station to another as a mobile device moves across different cells in a cellular network. Handoff strategies aim to ensure a seamless and uninterrupted service for the user, while minimizing the burden on the network resources and avoiding dropped calls or data loss.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/handoff-in-cellular-telecommunications/"><span data-contrast="auto">There are different types of handoff strategies, such as hard, soft, delayed, and mobile-assisted handoff, each with its own advantages and disadvantages</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Some of the <strong>main differences</strong> between these types of handoff strategies are:</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Hard handoff:</strong> This is when the connection to the old base station is terminated before establishing a new connection to the new base station. This is also known as &lsquo;break before make&rsquo; policy. Hard handoff is fast and simple, but it may cause a brief interruption in the service and a loss of quality. Hard handoff is usually implemented in networks that use different frequency bands or modulation schemes for different cells, such as TDMA or FDMA.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Soft handoff:</strong> This is when the connection to the old base station is maintained until a new connection to the new base station is established. This is also known as &lsquo;make before break&rsquo; policy. Soft handoff is more complex and resource-intensive, but it provides a smoother and more reliable service. Soft handoff is usually implemented in networks that use the same frequency band or modulation scheme for different cells, such as CDMA or WCDMA.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Delayed handoff:</strong> This is when the handoff is postponed until the signal strength from the old base station drops below a certain threshold, or until a channel becomes available on the new base station. Delayed handoff may reduce the number of unnecessary handoffs, but it may also increase the risk of dropping the call or losing the data if the delay is too long or the network is congested. Delayed handoff may occur when the user is out of the coverage area or in a dead spot.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="2"><span data-contrast="auto"><strong>Delayed handoff:Mobile-assisted handoff:</strong> This is when the mobile device helps the network to decide when and where to perform the handoff, by measuring the signal strength from different base stations and reporting it to the network. Mobile-assisted handoff may improve the accuracy and efficiency of the handoff process, but it may also increase the battery consumption and the&nbsp;signaling&nbsp;overhead of the mobile device. Mobile-assisted handoff is often used in networks that use TDMA-based techniques, such as GSM.</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">In cellular networks,&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">prioritizing handoffs</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;is crucial to maintain seamless communication. Here are two strategies:</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Guard Channel Concept</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This strategy reserves a fraction of the total available channels in a cell exclusively for handoff requests from ongoing calls. While this method reduces the total carried traffic, as fewer channels are allocated to originating calls, it offers efficient spectrum utilization when dynamic channel assignment strategies are used. These strategies minimize the number of required guard channels through efficient demand-based allocation.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Queuing of Handoff Requests</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This method decreases the probability of forced termination of a call due to lack of available channels. There&rsquo;s a trade-off between the decrease in probability of forced termination and total carried traffic. Queuing is possible because there&rsquo;s a finite time interval between when the received signal level drops below the handoff threshold and when the call is terminated due to insufficient signal level. The delay time and size of the queue are determined from the traffic pattern of the particular service area. However, queuing does not guarantee zero probability of forced termination, as large delays can cause the received signal level to drop below the minimum required level to maintain communication, leading to forced termination.</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ol>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">These strategies aim to ensure smooth transitions during handoffs and minimize disruptions in communication.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3><span data-contrast="auto">Practical Handoff Consideration</span>&nbsp;</h3>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">In cellular networks, practical considerations for handoffs involve addressing challenges that arise due to varying mobile velocities. High-speed vehicles might require frequent handoffs as they pass through cell coverage regions quickly, while pedestrian users might not need a handoff during a call. The addition of microcells for capacity can burden the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) if high-speed users are constantly being passed between these small cells.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">To handle the simultaneous traffic of high-speed and low-speed users while minimizing MSC intervention, several schemes have been devised. One such scheme is the umbrella cell approach. This technique involves using different antenna heights and power levels to provide &ldquo;large&rdquo; and &ldquo;small&rdquo; cells co-located at a single location. This approach ensures that the number of handoffs is minimized for high-speed users and provides additional microcell channels for pedestrian users.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Another practical limitation is the difficulty in obtaining new cell sites, especially in urban areas due to zoning laws, ordinances, and other non-technical barriers. As a result, it&rsquo;s often more attractive for cellular providers to install additional channels and base stations at the same physical location of an existing cell, rather than finding new site locations. The speed of each user may be estimated by the base station. This approach helps to manage handoffs effectively in a cellular network.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Practical Handoff Consideration&nbsp;contiuned:</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Cell Dragging</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This is a handoff problem in microcell systems. It occurs when pedestrian users provide a strong signal to the base station, especially in urban environments with a line-of-sight radio path. As the user moves away slowly, the signal strength does not decay rapidly, potentially causing interference and traffic management issues.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Handoff Thresholds</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: To solve the cell dragging problem, handoff thresholds and radio coverage parameters need careful adjustment.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="3" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Handoff Time</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: In first-generation&nbsp;analog&nbsp;cellular systems, a handoff typically takes about 10 seconds once the signal level is below the handoff threshold. In contrast, modern digital cellular systems like GSM have reduced this time to 1 or 2 seconds.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="4" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Handoff Decisions</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: Newer cellular systems can make handoff decisions based on a wide range of metrics, not just signal strength. For instance, co-channel and adjacent channel interference levels can be measured at the base station.</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span data-contrast="auto">Co-channel Interference</span>&nbsp;</h3>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">The selected text discusses the following key points:</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="5" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Interference</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This is a major limiting factor in the performance of cellular radio systems. It can originate from various sources, including another mobile in the same cell, a call in progress in a&nbsp;neighboring&nbsp;cell, other base stations operating in the same frequency band, or any noncellular system that inadvertently leaks energy into the cellular frequency band.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="6" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Effects of Interference</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: Interference on voice channels causes cross talk, where the subscriber hears interference in the background due to an undesired transmission. On control channels, interference leads to missed and blocked calls due to errors in the digital&nbsp;signaling.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="7" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Severity of Interference</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: Interference is more severe in urban areas, due to the greater HF noise floor and the large number of base stations and mobiles. It has been recognized as a major bottleneck in increasing capacity and is often responsible for dropped calls.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="8" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Types of Interference</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: The two major types of system-generated cellular interference are co-channel interference and adjacent channel interference. Even though interfering signals are often generated within the cellular system, they are difficult to control in practice due to random propagation effects. Interference due to out-of-band users, which arises without warning due to front end overload of subscriber equipment or intermittent intermodulation products, is even more difficult to control. In practice, the transmitters from competing cellular carriers are often a significant source of out-of-band interference.</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span data-contrast="auto">Co-Channel Interference and How to minimize it:</span>&nbsp;</h3>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="9" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Frequency Reuse</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This is a technique used in cellular networks where the same set of frequencies are used in multiple cells within a given coverage area. These cells are known as&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">co-channel cells</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="10" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Co-channel Interference</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: Interference between signals from co-channel cells is referred to as co-channel interference. Unlike thermal noise, which can be overcome by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), co-channel interference cannot be combated by simply increasing the carrier power of a transmitter. This is because an increase in carrier transmit power increases the interference to&nbsp;neighboring&nbsp;co-channel cells.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="11" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Reducing Co-channel Interference</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: To reduce co-channel interference, co-channel cells must be physically separated by a minimum distance to provide sufficient isolation due to propagation.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="12" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Co-channel Interference Ratio</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: When the size of each cell is approximately the same, and the base stations transmit the same power, the co-channel interference ratio becomes a function of the radius of the cell &reg; and the distance between&nbsp;centers&nbsp;of the nearest co-channel cells (D). By increasing the ratio of D/R, the spatial separation between co-channel cells relative to the coverage distance of a cell is increased, thus reducing interference.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="13" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Co-channel Reuse Ratio (Q)</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This parameter is related to the cluster size (N) and is given by the formula</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="14" data-aria-level="1"><span data-contrast="auto">.A small value of Q provides larger capacity since the cluster size N is small, whereas a large value of Q improves the transmission quality due to a smaller level of co-channel interference. A trade-off must be made between these two objectives in actual cellular design.</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span data-contrast="auto">Adjacent&nbsp;Channel Interference</span>&nbsp;</h3>
    <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Adjacent Channel Interference</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;is a type of interference that occurs when signals, which are adjacent in frequency to the desired signal, interfere with the reception of the desired signal.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/co-channel-and-adjacent-channel-interference-in-mobile-computing/"><span data-contrast="auto">This interference is due to imperfect receiver filters that allow nearby frequencies to leak into the passband</span></a><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/co-channel-and-adjacent-channel-interference-in-mobile-computing/"><span data-contrast="auto">1</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Two scenarios where this can be particularly problematic are:</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="1" data-aria-level="2"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Near-Far Effect</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This occurs when an adjacent channel user is transmitting in very close range to a subscriber&rsquo;s receiver, while the receiver is trying to receive a base station on the desired channel.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/co-channel-and-adjacent-channel-interference-in-mobile-computing/"><span data-contrast="auto">In this case, the nearby transmitter captures the receiver of the subscriber</span></a><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/co-channel-and-adjacent-channel-interference-in-mobile-computing/"><span data-contrast="auto">1</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="2" data-aria-level="2"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Close Adjacent Channel Mobile</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This occurs when a mobile close to a base station transmits on a channel close to one being used by a weak mobile.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/co-channel-and-adjacent-channel-interference-in-mobile-computing/"><span data-contrast="auto">The base station may have difficulty distinguishing the desired mobile user from the &ldquo;bleedover&rdquo; caused by the close adjacent channel mobile</span></a><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/co-channel-and-adjacent-channel-interference-in-mobile-computing/"><span data-contrast="auto">1</span></a><span data-contrast="auto">.</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Enhancing Capacity in Cellular Systems</span></strong>&nbsp;</h3>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">As the demand for wireless service escalates, the number of channels allocated to a cell eventually becomes inadequate to support the required number of users. At this juncture, cellular design techniques are necessary to provide more channels per unit coverage area. Techniques such as cell splitting, sectoring, and coverage zone approaches are employed in practice to expand the capacity of cellular systems.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Cell splitting facilitates an orderly growth of the cellular system. Sectoring uses directional antennas to further manage interference and frequency reuse of channels. The zone microcell concept distributes the cell&rsquo;s coverage and extends the cell boundary to hard-to-reach areas.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">While cell splitting increases the number of base stations to enhance capacity, sectoring and zone microcells depend on base station antenna placements to improve capacity by reducing co-channel interference. Cell splitting and zone microcell techniques do not suffer the trunking inefficiencies experienced by sectored cells, and enable the base station to oversee all handoff tasks related to the microcells, thus reducing the computational load at the Mobile Switching Center (MSC).&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <div id = "User">
    <strong><span data-contrast="auto">Cell Splitting</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;is a technique used in cellular systems to increase capacity. It involves subdividing a congested cell into smaller cells, each with its own base station, reduced antenna height, and transmitter power. This increases the number of times that channels are reused, thus increasing capacity. If every cell&rsquo;s radius were halved, approximately four times as many cells would be needed to cover the same area, thereby increasing the number of channels and capacity. This allows a system to grow by replacing large cells with smaller ones, without disrupting the channel allocation scheme needed to maintain the minimum co-channel reuse ratio.</span>&nbsp;
</div>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">cell sectorization Splitting (theorectically&nbsp;hexagonal) cells into multiple independent sectors (typically 3) that each have their own transmit and receive facilities.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Cell splitting and sectoring are two techniques used to improve capacity in cellular systems.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Cell Splitting</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This technique improves capacity by rescaling the system. It involves decreasing the cell radius &reg; while keeping the co-channel reuse ratio (D/R) unchanged. This increases the number of channels per unit area.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Sectoring</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This is another method to increase capacity while keeping the cell radius unchanged. It involves decreasing the D/R ratio, which is achieved by reducing the number of cells in a cluster and thus increasing frequency reuse. However, to do this, it&rsquo;s necessary to reduce the relative interference without decreasing the transmit power.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">Co-channel interference in a cellular system may be decreased by replacing a single omni-directional antenna at the base station with several directional antennas, each radiating within a specified sector. By using directional antennas, a given cell will receive interference and transmit with only a fraction of the available co-channel cells.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">When sectoring is employed, the channels used in a particular cell are broken down into sectored groups and are used only within a particular sector. Assuming 7-cell reuse, for the case of 120&deg; sectors, the number of interferers in the first tier is reduced from 6 to 2. This is because only 2 of the 6 co-channel cells receive interference with a particular sector. This technique for decreasing co-channel interference and thus increasing system capacity by using directional antennas is called sectoring. The factor by which the co-channel interference is reduced depends on the amount of sectoring used. A cell is normally partitioned into three 120&deg; sectors or six 60&deg; sectors.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Cell Splitting</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Cell Sectoring</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">&nbsp;are two methods used in cellular networks to increase capacity and reduce interference. Here&rsquo;s how they differ:</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
        <li data-aria-posinset="15" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Cell Splitting</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This involves dividing a cell into smaller cells, each with its own base station, to increase the overall capacity of the network. The process involves reducing the radius of the cell, which results in an increase in the number of cells covering the same area. This allows for more channels to be used, thus increasing the capacity. However, this method requires a significant number of base stations and can lead to frequent handoffs.</span>&nbsp;</li>
        <li data-aria-posinset="16" data-aria-level="1"><strong><span data-contrast="auto">Cell Sectoring</span></strong><span data-contrast="auto">: This method involves dividing a cell into several sectors, each with its own set of frequencies. Unlike cell splitting, the radius of the cell remains the same in cell sectoring. This method increases capacity by reducing co-channel interference through the use of directional antennas. However, it requires more antennas per base station and can lead to a decrease in efficiency due to the reduction in channel groups.</span>&nbsp;</li>
    </ul>
    <h3><span data-contrast="auto">Channel Allocation</span>&nbsp;</h3>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">- Fixed Channel Assignment : This strategy allocates a predetermined set of voice channels to each cell, and allows borrowing channels from&nbsp;neighboring&nbsp;cells if needed&sup1;[1]. It has advantages of fixed characteristics and acceptable performance, but disadvantages of localized traffic congestion.</span>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><span data-contrast="auto">- Dynamic Channel Assignment : This strategy allocates channels to cells on demand, based on an algorithm that considers factors such as blocking probability, frequency reuse, and interference. It has advantages of increased channel utilization and decreased call blocking, but disadvantages of increased storage and computational load.</span>&nbsp;</p>
